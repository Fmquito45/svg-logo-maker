  # svg-logo-maker

  ## Description
    I built this project to help user generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. In order to build this project I had to apply new skill sets that I've learned throughout the module. This is what motivated me in creating this project, to see it come to life and be beneficial to every coder out there and make it easier for them to generate their own logos. Instead of following a manuel instruction of the website and setting your own shapes and color/sizes and font colors you can follow along this projects built in node.js command line application. The application will prompt the user with questions to answer, provide text?, text color?, chose shape? and shape color? With the users input it will generate the svg logo and save it to a 
    .svg file. In order to build this project I had to apply some new skills sets to have it fucntioning properly. I had to learn a new npm testing dependencie, Jest. This allowed me to create functions based on my testing scripts. And for each test passed, I was able to verify proper coding. In this case I tested for a shapes assinged shape and color and had expectations when render the function. This allowed me to continue with the use of Inquirer to later render on the input data to get the string for svg on its shape chosen and color assigned. All rendered data were properly exported to be able to use in other functions to complete the built svg string to generate the logo and be able to save in a file. With these skills applied I was able to get this project to operate as it should. It was a great experience to create a node.js command-line application that will help users build thier logos and save them to a file based on thier inputs.
